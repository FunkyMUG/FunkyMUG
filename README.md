# Welcome to the Funky Morph Users Group (FunkyMUG)
This repo is intended to provide resources to help increase inclusion and transparency in functional morphology and comparative biomecahanics by helping to reduce exclusionary barriers to learning new techniques, with an emphasis on open-access techniques and promoting the professional development of early career scientists.

## Vision statement
Stay tuned!


## Current schedule
* Feb. 22, 2021: [Jonathan Huie](https://twitter.com/jmhuiee) and [Zach Quigley](https://twitter.com/ZachQuigley_) demonstrate how to render and measure 3D models from micro-CT image stacks. 
* March 15, 2021 (tentative): [Dr. Eva Herbst](https://twitter.com/EvaCHerbst) demonstrates how to prep your 3D models for biomechanical analyses (e.g., FEA).
* April 12, 2021 (tentative): [Dr. Arthur Porto](https://twitter.com/ArtPorto) demonstrates how to use machine learning to automate the landmarking of 3D models. 
* (tenative): an additional speaker on biomechanical modeling!
