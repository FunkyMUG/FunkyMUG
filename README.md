# Welcome to the Funky Morph Users Group (FunkyMUG)
This repo is intended to provide resources to help increase inclusion and transparency in functional morphology and comparative biomecahanics by helping to reduce exclusionary barriers to learning new techniques, with an emphasis on open-access techniques and promoting the professional development of early career scientists.

## How it started
The Fins and Limbs lab is located at The George Washington University (Washington, DC, USA) and is led by Dr. Sandy Kawano [https://sandykawano.weebly.com/](https://sandykawano.weebly.com/). We are a team of functional morphologists and biomechanics interested in the morphological and functional diversity of organisms and share interests in inclusive instruction, equitable access to educational outcomes, open science, and mentoring. The Funky Morph Users Group builds off of the popular R Users Group that provides procedural knowledge of computational methods through experience learning, with an eye towards open-access software, but shifting the towards to current methods to study the form and function of organisms. Learning a new technique can be daunting and time-consuming so we want to help equip users with skills and knowledge they need to get started. As such, we are currently focusing on getting users introduced to current (and new!) techniques so they feel comfortable to engage in other user communities. 

## Current schedule
* Feb. 22, 2021: [Jonathan Huie](https://twitter.com/jmhuiee) and [Zach Quigley](https://twitter.com/ZachQuigley_) demonstrate how to render and measure 3D models from micro-CT image stacks. 
* March 15, 2021 (tentative): [Dr. Eva Herbst](https://twitter.com/EvaCHerbst) demonstrates how to prep your 3D models for biomechanical analyses (e.g., FEA).
* April 12, 2021 (tentative): [Dr. Arthur Porto](https://twitter.com/ArtPorto) demonstrates how to use machine learning to automate the landmarking of 3D models. 
* (tenative): an additional speaker on biomechanical modeling!
