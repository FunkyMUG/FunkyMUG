Dr. Eva Herbst (she / her / hers) is the invited speaker for our FunkyMUG meeting on Monday, March 15, 2021, from 3:30 - 4:30 pm (EST)!
Eva is a postdoctoral researcher at the Palaeontological Institute and Museum through the University of Zurich. 
She currently working on using 3D biomechanical modeling (including finite element analysis) to investigate form and function in Triassic reptiles, which exhibit tremendous morphological diversity in their skulls. 
For her PhD, she worked on limb range of motion in salamanders and early tetrapods with Dr. John Hutchinson in the Structure and Motion Lab at the Royal Veterinary College. 
She has extensive training in paleontology, 3D morphology, biomecahnics, and bone biology and really enjoys developing new methods (and even have been getting into coding a bit) that can be applied to her research.

## Synopsis of workshop
We will go through a step-by-step interactive tutorial on cleaning meshes in `Blender`. 
The goal is to create a watertight, manifold mesh that can be used for finite element analysis or 3D printing. 
A "messy" 3D mesh will be provided by Dr. Herbst, but feel free to bring your own to test out the workflow!

## Learning objectives
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to
1. load mesh in `Blender`, 
2. manipulate mesh in `Blender` (spin it around, zoom in, rename, etc), 
3. go through all steps of the `Blender` cleaning process (including running a script to check for sharp edges).

## Instructions for participants
Please read through the following instructions prior to the workshop:
1. Download the most recent version of `Blender`: [https://www.blender.org/download/](https://www.blender.org/download/). 
2. Book Dr. Herbst's Github guide on mesh cleaning: [https://github.com/evaherbst/Blender_remeshing_guide](https://github.com/evaherbst/Blender_remeshing_guide). Have it handy during the workshop because we will want to copy and paste the script in that repository (alternatively you can download and unzip the `Blender` repository so that you have the "Select_Angles_Python_Script.txt" script locally on your computer).
