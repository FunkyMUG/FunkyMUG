# Get involved!




## Why contribute?

## Who can contribute? 
Anyone interested in advancing transparency, reproducibility, and inclusivity in biology labs is welcome to contribute! Diversity promotes innovation and creativity so marginalized groups are particularly encouraged to participate. 

## What are examples of how to contribute?
* Submit a feature request under "Issues" (e.g., "add a new template for writing exams in R")
* Submit a bug / error / typo under "Issues" (e.g., "link to website X is broken")
* Recommend modifications to existing material by submitting a pull request (see section below about How to Submit a Pull Request)
* Comment on existing issues (this helps to build community along our users while also applying your unique areas of expertise!)

## How to Submit a Pull Request
Please read these instructions on how to submit a pull request on GitHub: https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests. When submitting a pull request, please include a clear and concise description of the changes you are proposing. If applicable, please also include a short description about how these changes might be helpful for others (e.g., "added new template for writing a mentoring plan for students seeking careers outside of academia because previous documents focused on only academic job seekers").
