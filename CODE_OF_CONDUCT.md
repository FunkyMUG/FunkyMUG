# Code of Conduct for the Mid-Atlantic Functional Morphology Users Group

## Group Mission

The Mid-Atlantic Functional Morphology Users Group aims to create a productive and supportive space and community for regional morphologists and biomechanists of all career stages and levels of expertise to share and gain procedural knowledge of collecting and analyzing data through experiential learning (i.e., discussion and practice). In particular, the group aims to elevate early career scientists, including students, and members of underrepresented and underserved groups in science as knowledge leaders. 

Members of the Users Group must abide by the Code of Conduct (adapted from https://paleopercs.com/code-of-conduct/) as a commitment to these aims and to promoting and maintaining a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible learning environment for all. All participants (including guest speakers) will agree to adhere to the following tenets while attending live sessions and while otherwise contributing to group correspondences and materials, including but not limited to emails, surveys, and the group resource repository. This form must be signed before attending sessions and accessing group materials. 

## Interactions with Group Members
Participants are expected to treat one another with dignity and respect regardless of physical appearance, background, and identity, including but not limited to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental ability, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion (or lack thereof), political view, immigration status, family status, socioeconomic background, educational background, career stage, military service, or veteran status. 

All discourse will be professional and constructive. Any questions, comments, or behaviors that may reasonably be assumed to have the effect of creating, contributing to, or perpetuating an atmosphere that is hostile toward or damaging to a person or group are prohibited, including but not limited to sexist, racist, LGBTQIA+-phobic, and otherwise discriminatory jokes and language, insults, threats, unwelcome sexual attention, sharing sexually explicit or violent material, or encouraging any such behaviors. 

Harassment and other prohibited behavior will result in organizers taking immediate action appropriate to the violation, including warning the offender and / or expulsion from the group; participants asked to cease their behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns about the group environment, please contact one of the organizers in the Zoom chat during live sessions or via email, or submit a report through the anonymous Google Form for the group (see ‘Reporting CoC Violations’ below).

## Group Sharing and Privacy
Pending the approval of each session leader / guest speaker, sessions will be recorded and uploaded with closed captions to a central repository for group members to access for personal use at their convenience. A session leader / guest speaker may also choose to share the recording of their session publicly. Members consent to being recorded during these live meetings by signing this document and with their attendance. Members will be notified when sessions will be recorded and when those recordings could be shared publicly by the speaker(s). Members may not share recordings, session materials, notes, or any other contents of the repository with non-group members (i.e., anyone who has not read and signed this document). 

Group members may not share the intellectual property of participants (i.e., other members and guest speakers) without their explicit consent, including but not limited to unpublished data and techniques. Group members may not share personal information of participants without their explicit consent, including but not limited to private contact information and photos. 

## Reporting CoC Violations
Organizers will enforce the CoC to ensure that all participants feel that they and their intellectual property are supported and secure. If you experience or witness CoC violations or have any other concerns, please reach us at FunkMUGers@gmail.com, contact one of the organizers directly - Emily Naylor (enaylor@gwu.edu), Sandy Kawano (smkawano@gwu.edu), Jonathan Huie (jonathanmhuie@gmail.com), or Zach Quigley (zmquigely@gwu.edu) - or use our anonymous Google Form (https://forms.gle/9wFWAaFytv18Hsoe8).
