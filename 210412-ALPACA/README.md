Dr. Arthur Porto (he / him / his) is the invited speaker for our FunkyMUG meeting on Monday, April 12, 2021, from 3:30 - 5:30 pm (EST)!
Arthur is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Biological Sciences and Center for Computation and Technology at Louisiana State University. 
His research focuses on understanding the evolvability of complex organisms, with particular emphasis on the role of modularity and developmental constraints in shaping multivariate evolution. 
He is currently leading several projects with research organisms that range from marine invertebrates to mammals. In his research, he tends to use a wide array of approaches, varying from genomics to machine-learning. Arthur was also short-listed for the Robert May Prize, awarded by Methods in Ecology and Evolution (read more about it here: [https://methodsblog.com/2021/04/06/the-need-to-quantify-complex-shapes/](https://methodsblog.com/2021/04/06/the-need-to-quantify-complex-shapes/)).
You can find out more about his lab at [https://agporto.github.io/](https://agporto.github.io/) and / or his Twitter account at [@ArtPorto](https://twitter.com/ArtPorto).

## Registration
Registration is free! Please sign up by completing the following Google Form: [https://forms.gle/4FC6YGMHFV69vcHV9](https://forms.gle/4FC6YGMHFV69vcHV9)
* If you plan to attend the live session synchronously, please register by 11:59 pm (ET) on April 9, 2021. 
* If you would like access to the materials and recording but cannot attend the live session, please use the same registration form to be added to our email list. Users may register after the event to gain access to the materials. 

## Synopsis of workshop
We will go through an introduction to automating the landmarking of 3D models through `ALPACA` (Automated Landmarking through Pointcloud Alignment and Correspondence Analysis).
Arthur will do a full walk-through of the `ALPACA` pipeline, including choice of hyperparameters and batch approaches. 
He will also discuss two extensions of the `ALPACA` pipeline currently under development.

## Learning objectives
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to use `ALPACA` effectively as a way to automate landmark data collection in 3D objectives.

## Instructions for participants
Please read through the following instructions prior to the workshop:
1. Download `3D Slicer`. Instructions [HERE](https://download.slicer.org/).
2. Participants should install the latest version of `SlicerMorph` on the `3D Slicer` application. The latest instructions are available [HERE](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph#installation). More detailed instructions can be found here: 
https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Spr_2021/tree/main/TechCheckin#readme
3. Review a general introduction to `ALPACA` is also available here: 
https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Spr_2021/tree/main/Day_4/ALPACA

**NOTE:** If you are new to `3D Slicer` and installing the `SlicerMorph` module, then our 1st workshop on `3D Slicer` may help! Information about this workshop is available [HERE](https://github.com/FunkyMUG/FunkyMUG/tree/main/210222-3DSlicer). You may still register for the event to obtain access to our video recording of the workshop.
