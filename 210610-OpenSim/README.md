Dr. Zanne Cox (she / her / hers) is the invited speaker for our FunkyMUG meeting on Thursday, June 10, 2021, from 3:30 - 5:30 pm (EST)!
Zanne is a Research Scientist at Duke University and a co-founder and board member of the Comparative Neuromuscular Biomechanics working group through the International Society of Biomechanics. She was also a Visiting Scholar for OpenSim at Stanford University. 
Her research integrates engineering, biology, and physics to understand how animals move and incorporates a broad array of in vivo experiments, robotics, and musculoskeletal computational modelling. A central theme of her research is to determine how spring-like ('elastic') biomaterials expand the limits of muscle-driven movements to increase organismal performance and involves important questions, such as how physics may limit biology, how animals detect and modulate their motor control in response to different environmental challenges, and how animals can tune their elastic systems to copmensate for environmental changes or injury. Moreover, Zanne is a dynamic researcher who is both a scientist and maker! Check out some of her woodworking projects here: [https://www.zannecox.com/woodworking.html](https://www.zannecox.com/woodworking.html).

## Synopsis of workshop
1. Introduction: What is OpenSim and why would you want to use it?  
2. Modifying muscles and running simulations through the OpenSim Gui. 
3. Incorporating experimental data 
4. Building and modifying models through Matlab or Python scripting.

## Learning objectives
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
1. be able to identify pros and cons of using OpenSim, 
2. modify models and run simple simulations through the gui.  
3. be able to identify the types of projects that could be accomplished through matlab or python scripting and access code examples and websites to learn more. 

## Instructions for participants
Please read through the following instructions prior to the workshop:
1. Please download and install OpenSim on your desktop. [https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu/display/OpenSim/Installing+OpenSim](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu/display/OpenSim/Installing+OpenSim)   
2. Download example files [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5gcfatq2581jrjg/AAC-68NUr2a_T3YpW2zXmtzfa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5gcfatq2581jrjg/AAC-68NUr2a_T3YpW2zXmtzfa?dl=0) and put in OpenSim Code directory.  This is usually located at C:\OpenSim 4.2\Resources\Code
